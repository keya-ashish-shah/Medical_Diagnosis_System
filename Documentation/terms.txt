heart 
SLIDER
0: Typical Angina
Chest pain that occurs during physical exertion or stress.

Caused by reduced blood flow to the heart (ischemia).

Predictable and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin.

Strong indicator of coronary artery disease (CAD).

1: Atypical Angina
Chest discomfort that doesnâ€™t match the classic angina pattern.

Might not always occur with exertion.

Still may be related to heart disease but less clearly than typical angina.

2: Non-Anginal Pain
Chest pain that is not related to heart ischemia.

Could be due to muscle strain, acid reflux, anxiety, etc.

Less likely to be heart-related.

3: Asymptomatic
No chest pain or discomfort at all.

The person may have heart disease without any noticeable symptoms.

Sometimes called silent ischemia â€” can be dangerous because it goes unnoticed.

Resting Blood Pressure
Resting Blood Pressure (RBP) refers to the blood pressure measured when a person is at rest, typically sitting quietly for a few minutes.


ðŸ”¹ Glucose â€“ The Fuel
Glucose is sugar in your blood, and it's your bodyâ€™s main source of energy.

 Insulin â€“ The Regulator
Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas.

It acts like a key: it unlocks your cells so glucose can enter and be used for energy.

Without insulin, glucose stays in the blood instead of entering cells.


Glucose	70â€“100 mg/dL
Insulin	2â€“20 ÂµIU/mL (lab-dependent)




THYROID
TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)
High TSH â†’ Often means thyroid is underactive (hypothyroidism) â†’ TSH rises to stimulate more T3/T4.

Low TSH â†’ Often means thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroidism) â†’ TSH drops because T3/T4 levels are already high.


pcod
LH (Luteinizing Hormone) in PCOD/PCOS â€” Explained
Ratio	Interpretation
~1:1	Normal in healthy women
> 2:1 or 3:1	Common in PCOS â€” suggests hormonal imbalance


anxiety
The GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) is a self-reported screening tool used to assess the severity of anxiety.

A 7-question questionnaire.

Each question relates to anxiety symptoms over the past 2 weeks.

Scored from 0 to 3 per question:

0 = Not at all

1 = Several days

2 = More than half the days

3 = Nearly every day



Thalach = Maximum Heart Rate Achieved . It represents the highest heart rate a patient reached during a stress test (often a treadmill exercise test).
